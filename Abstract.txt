For our project, we've decided to use this as our dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/bwandowando/ukraine-russian-crisis-twitter-dataset-1-2-m-rows which is a collection of almost 8 million tweets regarding the recent war between Ukraine and Russia. The dataset is approximately 2GB in size as per the project requirements and comes in a .CSV format. What we're planning to do with this dataset is similar to what we did for lab 4 in class, using the tweets and analyzing them to determine which posts were positive, negative, and neutral in terms of emotional sentiment. Furthermore, since lab 4 will be continued in class tomorrow March 14 we will also be incorporating what we do in that lab into our project. We find this dataset to have a good balance between the more simple concepts we've learned in class in addition to the current concepts we're learning and hopefully we can incorporate more advanced analysis techniques into this project later during the semester.
